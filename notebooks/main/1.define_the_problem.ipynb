    "- **Task**: Predict whether a credit card transaction is fraud.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Maximize accuracy\n",
    "- **Experience**: Credit card transactions\n",
    "- **Similar Projects**: Detecting churn\n",
    "- **Assumptions**: Amount and the first principle components will be the most important variables.  We can transform time into the # of transactions within +/- 1000 seconds.  Shap feature importance will be a good start.\n",
    "- **Why**: Banks are liable for credit card fraud over $50, so they must minimize this cost by catching it with machines.\n",
    "- **Benefits**: Being able to stop a transaction suspected of fraud.  We can freeze a card and investigate it for fraud.  The model will improve as we find more fraud using the model.\n",
    "- **Handoff**: We will handoff this model by saving it to a file and uploading the model to our server.  We will run a prediction after every transaction, so we can reject fradulent transactions, freeze the account, and update the database which alerts the investigations department.\n",
    "- **Buy-in**: We need buy-in from the engineering department responsible for code that runs after every transaction.  We also need buy-in from investigators, to make sure they will be willing to investigate and resolve these frozen accounts.\n",
    "- **Data Available**: time in seconds, amount, 28 principle components from PCA\n",
    "- **Data I Wish I Had**: whether the chip reader was used, whether the chip reader was attempted to be used, item purchased, time of day purchased, user history data\n",
    "- **Data to Ignore**: drop time in seconds after doing feature engineering with it.  Drop a lot of the principle components, but first check for Shap importance of all of them\n",
    "- **Development Data Format**: CSV\n",
    "- **Missing Data**: None\n",
    "- **Anonymize Data**: Already done\n",
    "- **Change Datatypes**: Not necessary, small file of numbers\n",
    "- **Test Set Size**: Dev set and test set will be 10,0000 samples each\n",
    "- **Training Set Sampling Plan**: No sampling.  Training will be approximately 300,000 samples\n"
